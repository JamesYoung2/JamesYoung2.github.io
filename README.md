## Research

I'm currently working with [Dr. Justin Hoffmeier](https://floridapoly.edu/faculty/bios/justin-hoffmeier/) conducting research on zero-divisor graphs and exact zero-divisor graphs. If you want to read more about them and even see a live demo, check it out here:

## Writeups

I also love cybersecurity! In cybersecurity, I do CTF (Capture-The-Flag) challenges that involve hacking into a controlled environment to get a flag. I love making detailed witeups about these challenges to teach topics to people at a technical level. If you want to read some of my writeups, you can check them out here:
